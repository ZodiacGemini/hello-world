My name is Alexander and I have a bachelors' degree in strategic communication, majoring in cognitive psychology and neurology. Today I work as a substitute teacher combined with SEO consulting. To fully understand and work with digital communication I feel the need to learn programming since this is the foundation which everything then is being built upon.
